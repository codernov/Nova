**Firmware for Quansheng UV-K5 by Codernov Electronics Repair, a fork of r3b0rn by fagci**  
  
At Codernov Electronics Repair, we recognize that the intention behind r3b0rn is commendable; however, we believe that the current concept and execution lack the precision and reliability needed for optimal performance. Therefore, we are committed to rethinking the underlying functionality of the firmware. Our goal is to deliver a robust, reliable, and bug-free solution that stands out and rivals the best in the industry.
