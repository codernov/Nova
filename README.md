# Codernov Electronics Repair; Firmware for Quansheng UV-K5
**Firmware for Quansheng UV-K5 by Codernov Electronics Repair, forked from r3b0rn**  
  
At Codernov Electronics Repair, we recognize the commendable intentions behind the r3b0rn project; however, we believe that the current concept and execution lack the precision and reliability necessary for optimal performance. Our commitment is to rethink the underlying functionality of the firmware to deliver a robust, reliable, and bug-free solution that stands out and rivals the best in the industry.
